          <p class="story">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with
            a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
            far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
          <p class="story">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have
            been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
            potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special
            energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a
            prodigiously violent instant.</p>

          <p class="story">In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever
            beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s
            ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory
            of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
          <p class="story">Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of
            the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
          <p class="story">Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background
            Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center
            for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>

            <h3>The Theory of Inflation</h3>
            <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe
              expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>
          </header>

          <div class="interactive-graphic">
            <p class="i1"><span class="subtitle">THE UNIVERSE</span> is just under 14 billion years old. From our
              position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across.
              But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>
            <p class="i2"><span class="subtitle">NOT ENOUGH TIME</span> The universe is not old enough for light to have
              traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time
              for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.</p>
            <p class="i3"><span class="subtitle">DISTANT COFFEE</span>At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to
              look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its
              temperature and how much it has cooled.</p>
            <p class="i4"><span class="subtitle">COFFEE EVERYWHERE</span> Now turn around and look a mile in the other
              direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you
              see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</p>

            <p class="i5"><span class="subtitle">STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</span> There has not been enough time to carry
              coffee cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from
              a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.</p>
            <p class="i6"><span class="subtitle">INFLATION</span> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less
              than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light.
              Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of
              the universe.</p>
            <p class="i7"><span class="subtitle">FLUCTUATION</span> Astronomers have now detected evidence of these
              ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left
              over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>
            <p class="i8"><span class="subtitle">EXPANSION</span> Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot
              expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like
              inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>
